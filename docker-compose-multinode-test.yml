# This docker-compose file allows you creating several
# instances of the weaviate service. Just pass the number of
# weaviate nodes via the --scale option:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose-scale-test.yml up -d --scale weaviate=4
#Â Keep in mind that the weaviate-cluster service will always run, so you
# if you want to start a 5 node cluster the --scale option should be 4.
# To retrieve the host port and grpc to be used when connecting you can use the following:
# curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/nodes
