Weaviate is an open-source cloud-native vector database designed for building AI applications. It combines vector similarity search with keyword filtering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reranking within a single system. These features provide a reliable foundation for AI-powered applications such as RAG pipelines, chatbots, recommendation engines, summarizers, and classification systems.

Weaviate can vectorize your data at import time using AI models (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, etc.) or you can upload your own vector embeddings. Weaviate supports production-scale workloads by offering multi-tenancy, replication, authorization and [many more features](#weaviate-features).

To get started quickly, have a look at one of these tutorials:

- [Quickstart - Weaviate Cloud](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart)
- [Quickstart - local Docker instance](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart/local)

<!--
## Why Weaviate?

Weaviate uses state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models to turn your data - text, images, and more - into a searchable vector database.

Here are some highlights.

### Speed

Weaviate is fast. The core engine can run a 10-NN nearest neighbor search on millions of objects in milliseconds. See [benchmarks](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/benchmarks).

### Flexibility

Weaviate can **vectorize your data at import time**. Or, if you have already vectorized your data, you can **upload your own vectors** instead.

Modules give you the flexibility to tune Weaviate for your needs. More than two dozen modules connect you to popular services and model hubs such as OpenAI, Cohere, VoyageAI and HuggingFace. Use custom modules to work with your own models or third party services.

### Production-readiness

Weaviate is built with [scaling](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/concepts/cluster), [replication](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture), and [security](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/authentication) in mind so you can go smoothly from **rapid prototyping** to **production at scale**.

### Beyond search

Weaviate doesn't just power lightning-fast vector searches. Other superpowers include **recommendation**, **summarization**, and **integration with neural search frameworks**.

## Installation

Weaviate offers a multitude of installation and deployment options:

- [Docker](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/docker-installation)
- [Kubernetes](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/k8s-installation)
- [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)

See the [installation docs](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy) for more deployment options like [AWS](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/aws-marketplace) and [GCP](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/gcp-marketplace).

## Getting started

The following Python example shows how easy it is to populate a Weaviate database with data, create vector embeddings and perform semantic search:

```python
import os
import weaviate
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType, Property

# Connect to Weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_local(
    headers={"X-OpenAI-Api-Key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}
)

# Create a collection
client.collections.create(
    name="Article",
    properties=[Property(name="content", data_type=DataType.TEXT)],
    vector_config=Configure.Vectors.text2vec_openai(),  # Use integrated vectorizers or bring your own vectors
)

# Insert objects
articles = client.collections.get("Article")
articles.data.insert_many(
    [
        {"content": "Vector databases enable semantic search"},
        {"content": "Machine learning models generate embeddings"},
        {"content": "Weaviate supports hybrid search capabilities"},
    ]
)
while len(articles) < 3: pass  # Wait for vectorization to complete

# Perform semantic search
results = articles.query.near_text(query="Search objects by meaning", limit=1)
print(results.objects[0])

client.close()
```

## Client libraries and APIs

Weaviate provides client libraries for several programming languages:
